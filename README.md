  Artificial Neural Network Tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of ANNs. Our Artificial Neural Network tutorial is developed for beginners as well as professions.

  The term "Artificial neural network" refers to a biologically inspired sub-field of artificial intelligence modeled after the brain. An Artificial neural network is usually a computational network based on biological neural networks that construct the structure of the human brain. Similar to a human brain has neurons interconnected to each other, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are linked to each other in various layers of the networks. These neurons are known as nodes.

  Artificial neural network tutorial covers all the aspects related to the artificial neural network. In this tutorial, we will discuss ANNs, Adaptive resonance theory, Kohonen self-organizing map, Building blocks, unsupervised learning, Genetic algorithm, etc.

**What is Artificial Neural Network?**

  The term "Artificial Neural Network" is derived from Biological neural networks that develop the structure of a human brain. Similar to the human brain that has neurons interconnected to one another, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are interconnected to one another in various layers of the networks. These neurons are known as nodes.
